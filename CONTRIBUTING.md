# How to contribute to Epic

:+1::tada: First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute! :tada::+1:

## Report issues or problems with the software

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/AlphonsG/EPIC-BBox-Cell-Tracking/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, use the relevant bug report [template](https://github.com/AlphonsG/EPIC-BBox-Cell-Tracking/issues/new/choose) to create one. 

* If not possible, you can [open a blank issue](https://github.com/AlphonsG/EPIC-BBox-Cell-Tracking/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Submitting Changes

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the change.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the change. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

* At lease one reviewer should be added so that the code is looked over by someone else.

Always write a clear log message for your commits, for example:

    $ git commit -m "A brief summary of the commit
    > 
    > A paragraph describing what changed and its impact."
